# Cyber AI

There’s a big gap between what AI can do in other fields like answering day-to-day questions to what they can do in crypto. Most AI Agents deployed with a token have no clue of the crypto world they are in by posting simple shills and answering generic comments on Twitter. What if every Crypto AI Agent can access the listing of trending crypto topics? What if they know who are the right people to talk to about a project or idea on Twitter? What if there’s actual copilot that does research for you on the newest investment thesis or shift in crypto narrative.
