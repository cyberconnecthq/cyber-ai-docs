# Cyber AI

There’s a significant gap between what AI can achieve in other fields (such as answering everyday questions) and what it can accomplish in the crypto space. Most AI agents deployed with a token have very limited understanding of the crypto world, often resorting to basic promotional posts or generic replies on Twitter. What if every Crypto AI Agent could access real-time listings of trending crypto topics? What if they knew exactly whom to engage with about a project or idea on Twitter? What if there were an actual copilot that could research the newest investment thesis or changing crypto narrative on your behalf?

Cyber Blockchain has built a social data layer that connects millions of users with wallets, Twitter accounts, and other valuable social graph data. Now, we’re launching Cyber AI—an AI model with real crypto intelligence—building on our past innovations such as the CyberConnect Social Graph Protocol, Cyber Blockchain, and more.
